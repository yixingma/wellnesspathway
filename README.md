♿ Project Overview: Wellness Pathway – an AI-Powered Accessibility Travel Companion

---------------------------
🌟 Vision
---------------------------
Wellness Pathway is an intelligent, AI-powered application designed to help people with disabilities or accessibility needs find suitable accommodations, restaurants, hotels, and Airbnb listings. It ensures that users can confidently plan their travel and daily activities with personalized, accessibility-aware recommendations.

---------------------------
🧠 Core Technology
---------------------------
Databricks Genie Multi-Agent Framework powers the backend intelligence of Wellness Pathway. The system uses a multi-agent architecture where each agent specializes in a specific domain (e.g., lodging, dining, transportation, accessibility compliance), and they collaborate to fulfill complex user queries.


---------------------------
🧩 Key Components
